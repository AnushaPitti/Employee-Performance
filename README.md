# Employee-Performance
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict employee perfomance rating. 
I cleaned and engineered features from classification techniques like SVC, DT, RF, with SVC performing best. 
This project strengthened my skills in data preprocessing, model optimization, and real-world decision-making.
